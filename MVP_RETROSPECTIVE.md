## MVP Retrospective

### Governance in Action

Our team closely followed the collaboration protocol outlined in **GOVERNANCE.md**, using GitHub for issues, projects, discussions, and pull requests. This ensured all work was documented, visible, and properly reviewed. What worked well was the structured workflow and clear task ownership, which kept the team aligned and productive. However, we realized that weekly sync meetings and additional quick check-ins were often excessive, as we could complete tasks efficiently without them. Going forward, we plan to streamline our meeting schedule to maintain productivity while reducing unnecessary time spent in check-ins.  

### Challenges & Learnings

The biggest technical challenge we faced was debugging complex code and integration issues. We relied heavily on **Replit** to test and debug, which required many attempts and iterations, but ultimately allowed us to identify and fix problems effectively. This experience reinforced the importance of persistence, systematic debugging, and using collaborative tools to accelerate troubleshooting.
