AI Debate Partner

**Mission Statement**: Empowering students to sharpen their critical
thinking, argumentation, and communication skills through on-demand,
AI-powered debate practice.

**The Problem:** Debate is one of the most effective ways to build
persuasive communication and critical reasoning skills. However,
opportunities to practice are limited: students often struggle to find
debate partners, structured practice sessions require significant
scheduling, and feedback is scarce outside of formal settings. This lack
of consistent practice limits skill development, confidence, and
performance in academic, professional, and personal contexts.

**Our Solution:** The **AI Debate Partner** is a web-based platform that
provides students with an instant, on-demand debate partner. Users can
choose a topic, select their stance, and the AI will automatically argue
the opposite side. Structured debate rounds, real-time counterarguments,
and personalized feedback ensure students build their skills in a way
that mirrors real-world debates---without needing a human partner. The
system also generates transcripts for later review and learning
reinforcement.

**Target User:** Our primary users are **students and educators** in
high school, college, and debate clubs who want accessible, flexible
practice. Secondary users include professionals preparing for
interviews, presentations, or public speaking who need a convenient tool
to refine their persuasive abilities.

## The Operating Model

## GOVERNANCE.md - The \"How\"

## **Team Roles & Responsibilities**

Our team will assign roles to ensure accountability while allowing
rotation as the project progresses:

-   **Project Lead: Romit Kulkarni** -- Oversees deadlines, organizes
    > meetings, ensures deliverables are on track.

-   **Technical Lead: Sean Cheng** -- Manages coding standards,
    > architecture decisions, and technical documentation.

-   **Design & UX Lead: Leigha Quinn** -- Focuses on user experience,
    > interface flow, and product usability.

-   **Research & Testing Lead: Zach Morgans** -- Collects background
    > research, validates AI outputs, and manages user testing/feedback.

> Roles will rotate at major project milestones to ensure shared
> experience and balanced workload.

## **Collaboration Protocol**

We will use GitHub as our central workspace:

-   **Issues** -- Each task or bug will be logged as an Issue with a
    > clear description and assignee.

-   **Projects** -- We will use GitHub Projects (Kanban board) to track
    > tasks under columns: *To Do, In Progress, Review, Done.*

-   **Discussions** -- For brainstorming, feature debates, and
    > non-urgent communication.

-   **Pull Requests** -- Required for merging code; at least one peer
    > review before approval.

**Meeting Schedule:**

-   Weekly sync meetings to review progress and upcoming tasks.

-   Quick check-ins (15 mins) twice per week if needed for blockers.

**Visibility:**

-   All work must be documented on GitHub (issues, commits, PRs).

-   No "offline" or hidden work --- everything should be trackable.

## **AI Usage Strategy**

### **Task Delegation**

-   **Ad-hoc Assistance:** Brainstorming feature ideas, drafting
    > documentation, debugging snippets, suggesting test cases.

-   **Systematic Automation:** Generating unit tests, summarizing
    > meeting notes, creating first drafts of repetitive documents.

### **Collaboration Protocol**

-   We treat AI as a **supporting collaborator** --- not an authority.

-   AI outputs must be reviewed, fact-checked, and adapted before
    > inclusion.

-   When AI is used for drafting or coding, contributions will be cited
    > in commit messages or documentation (e.g., "Initial draft
    > generated with AI assistance, refined by team").

## **Decision-Making Framework**

-   **Default:** Decisions will be made by **consensus** among the four
    > members.

-   **If no consensus:** The member whose role is most relevant (e.g.,
    > Technical Lead for architecture, Design Lead for UX) has final
    > say.

-   **Escalation:** If disagreement persists, the Project Lead will
    > facilitate a short discussion and call for a majority vote.

-   **Guiding Principle:** Keep the project moving forward --- decisions
    > should not block progress for more than one working session.
