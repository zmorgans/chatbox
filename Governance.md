# Team Roles & Responsibilities

Our team will assign roles to ensure accountability while allowing rotation as the project progresses:

- **Project Lead: Romit Kulkarni**  
  Oversees deadlines, organizes meetings, ensures deliverables are on track.

- **Technical Lead: Sean Cheng**  
  Manages coding standards, architecture decisions, and technical documentation.

- **Design & UX Lead: Leigha Quinn**  
  Focuses on user experience, interface flow, and product usability.

- **Research & Testing Lead: Zach Morgans**  
  Collects background research, validates AI outputs, and manages user testing/feedback.

> **Note:** Roles will rotate at major project milestones to ensure shared experience and balanced workload.

# Collaboration Protocol

We will use GitHub as our central workspace:

- **Issues** – Each task or bug will be logged as an Issue with a clear description and assignee.
- **Projects** – GitHub Projects (Kanban board) to track tasks under columns: `To Do`, `In Progress`, `Review`, `Done`.
- **Discussions** – For brainstorming, feature debates, and non-urgent communication.
- **Pull Requests** – Required for merging code; at least one peer review is needed before approval.

### 🗓 Meeting Schedule

- **Weekly sync meetings** to review progress and upcoming tasks.
- **Quick check-ins (15 mins)** twice per week if needed for blockers.

### 🔍 Visibility

- All work must be documented on GitHub (issues, commits, PRs).
- No “offline” or hidden work — everything should be trackable.

# AI Usage Strategy

### Task Delegation

- **Ad-hoc Assistance**: Brainstorming feature ideas, drafting documentation, debugging snippets, suggesting test cases.
- **Systematic Automation**: Generating unit tests, summarizing meeting notes, creating first drafts of repetitive documents.

### Collaboration Protocol

- AI is treated as a **supporting collaborator**, not an authority.
- AI outputs must be **reviewed, fact-checked, and adapted** before inclusion.
- When AI is used, contributions will be **cited in commit messages or documentation**  
  _Example: “Initial draft generated with AI assistance, refined by team”_

# Decision-Making Framework

- **Default**: Consensus among all four members.
- **If no consensus**: The member whose role is most relevant makes the final decision  
  _e.g., Technical Lead for architecture, Design Lead for UX._
- **Escalation**: Project Lead facilitates a short discussion and calls for a majority vote.

> **Guiding Principle:** Keep the project moving forward — decisions should not block progress for more than one working session.
