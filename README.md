## ❌ The Problem
Debate is one of the most effective ways to build persuasive communication and critical reasoning skills. However, opportunities to practice are limited:  
- Students often struggle to find debate partners.  
- Structured practice sessions require significant scheduling.  
- Feedback is scarce outside of formal settings.  

This lack of consistent practice limits skill development, confidence, and performance in academic, professional, and personal contexts.
